 #Assignment operators

# Add and Assign # a = a + b
# a= 3
# b=5
# a+=b
# print(a)

#  Subtract and Assign  a = a - b
# a=30
# b=20
# a-=b
# print(a)

 #Multiply and Assign  a = a * b
# a= 3
# b=5
# a*=b
# print(a)

# Divide and Assign a = a / b
# a=3
# b=5
# a/=b
# print(a)

# # Modulus and Assign a = a % b
# a=3
# b=15
# a%=b
# print(a)

# Divide (floor) and Assign a = a // b
# a=3
# b=5
# a//=b
# print(a)

# Exponent and Assign a = a ** b
# a=5
# b=4
# a**=b
# print(a)

''' Bitwise AND and Assign: This operator is used to perform Bitwise AND on
 both operands and then assigning the result to the left operand. a = a & b'''
# a=3
# b=5

''' Bitwise OR and Assign This operator is used to 
perform Bitwise OR on the operands and then assigning result to the left operand.
 a = a | b '''
# a=2
# b=8

# a|=b

'''Bitwise Right Shift and Assign: This operator is used to perform Bitwise right shift on the operands
 and then assigning result to the left operand.  '''
# a = a >> b
# a=3
# b=5

'''Bitwise Left Shift and Assign: This operator is used to perform Bitwise left shift on 
# the operands and then assigning result to the left operand.'''
